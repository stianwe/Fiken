  description: "\n## Introduction\n[Fiken.no](https://fiken.no) is an online accounting\
    \ system aimed at making accounting easy for small businesses. The API Module\
    \ allows other systems to integrate with Fiken. This document describes Fiken's\
    \ API.\n\n## Using the API\nUse of this API in production environments on live\
    \ data is normally associated with a fee for the end user (company). API access\
    \ costs 99kr per month and can be ordered through the Module access page under\
    \ Settings in your Fiken account. If you have any questions regarding the API\
    \ pricing, contact us at <api@fiken.no>.\n\nThe API provides two different ways\
    \ of authorizing requests.\n\n  1. OAuth2\n  2. Personal API tokens\n\nThird parties\
    \ that wish to integrate with Fiken on behalf of their customers should use the\
    \ OAuth2 authorization method. In order to develop OAuth2 applications that integrate\
    \ with this API you must log into your Fiken account and check the box saying\
    \ that you are a developer (**Rediger konto -> Profil -> Andre innstillinger**).\
    \ This will allow you to create an App by clicking on the \"API\" tab under Brukerinnstillinger.\
    \ If you don't have an existing Fiken account you can create a new user and demo\
    \ company (demoforetak) at no charge. Send an email to <api@fiken.no> to get free\
    \ access to Fiken for longer than the included 30 day free trial period. \n\n\
    Upon creation of the new App you will be provided a Client ID and Client Secret\
    \ that are needed for the OAuth2 authorization flow.\n\nThis will allow you to\
    \ use the API during development with up to 5 users. If you would like to use\
    \ the API with more than 5 users and gain production status, you will need to\
    \ send an email to <api@fiken.no> to gain full access to the API module.\n\nFiken\
    \ customers that wish to integrate their own solutions with this API can use personal\
    \ API tokens. Personal API tokens can be created in **Rediger konto -> API ->\
    \ Personlige API-nøkler**. Note that personal API tokens do not expire.\n\n##\
    \ Base URL\nAll URLs start with https://api.fiken.no/api/v2. Note that TLS is\
    \ required, unencrypted HTTP is not supported. Although we currently redirect\
    \ HTTP requests to HTTPS, you are not allowed to this with your application as\
    \ using HTTP is a security risk. In the future we might respond with 403 Forbidden\
    \ instead.\n\n## Concurrent requests / rate limiting\nYou are only allowed to\
    \ make a single concurrent API-request. Sending multiple requests concurrently\
    \ may result in a 429 error response. If you break this rule you might be banned.\
    \ In case of a ban please contact us to be unbanned.\n\nAPI calls may be slowed\
    \ if you execute more than 4 requests per second.\n\n## Personal API tokens\n\n\
    Personal API tokens can be created in **Rediger konto -> API**. Personal API tokens\
    \ never expire and can be revoked from the same place.\n\nTo use a personal API\
    \ token simply send it as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header:\n\n  \
    \  GET https://api.fiken.no/api/v2/companies\n    Authorization: Bearer <api token>\n\
    \n## Authorization with OAuth2\nFiken API V2 uses OAuth 2.0 for authorizing API\
    \ requests. Authorized requests to the API should use an `Authorization` header\
    \ with the value `Bearer <TOKEN>` where `<TOKEN>` is an access token obtained\
    \ through the OAuth flow.\n\n### Authorize Endpoint\n\nTo start the OAuth flow\
    \ in order to obtain an access token for a user, you will first have to get consent\
    \ from the user. To do this, direct your user to the authorization endpoint:\n\
    \n    GET https://fiken.no/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE\n\
    \nIf the user is logged in and accepts your request, the user is redirected back\
    \ to your redirect url. If the user is not logged in, the regular Fiken.no login\
    \ form is presented first, requiring the user to authenticate before accepting\
    \ or rejecting your request.\n\nIf the user rejects the request or if there is\
    \ an error in your request, the user is redirected back to your redirect url with\
    \ the parameters `error` and `error_description`. If the user rejected the request\
    \ the error code will be `access_denied`.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Name       \
    \   | Description                                                            \
    \                                          |\n| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| response_type | **Required** Should always be the value `code`        \
    \                                             |\n| client_id     | **Required**\
    \ The client id you received from Fiken when you registered your application \
    \                         |\n| redirect_uri  | **Required** The URL in your application\
    \ where users will be sent with an authorization code after authorization |\n\
    | state         | **Required** An unguessable random string, used to protect against\
    \ CSRF attacks                                  |\n\n\n### Token Endpoint\n\n\
    If the user accepts your request, Fiken redirects the user back to your `redirect_uri`\
    \ with a parameter named `code` as well as the state you provided in the previous\
    \ step in the `state` parameter. This temporary code will expire after a short\
    \ while.\n\nThe temporary authorization code can be exchanged for an access token\
    \ at the token endpoint.\n\nThe token endpoint is protected with Http Basic Authentication\
    \ and you should use your application client id and client secret as credentials\
    \ to authenticate.\n\n    POST https://fiken.no/oauth/token\n    Content-Type:\
    \ application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Authorization: Basic dXNlIHlvdXIgY2xpZW50IGlkOmFuZCBjbGllbnQgc2VjcmV0\n\
    \n    grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHCODE&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&state=STATE\n\
    \nThe response will contain the access token, a refresh token (see below) as well\
    \ as information about the expiry time for the token.\n\n    {\n      \"access_token\"\
    : \"K2QwoFp4ZfugWLWk7Ipu9kni5cyv3luXKQ-GDShvV2g=\",\n      \"refresh_token\":\
    \ \"naFOD_j8m6PFGcP0pfImVZlSxKklHLbgj9Hzao4rhg8=\",\n      \"token_type\": \"\
    bearer\",\n      \"expires_in\": 86157\n    }\n\nIf an error occurs during the\
    \ token exchange request, an error object is returned with an error and an error\
    \ description.\n\n    {\n        \"error\": \"invalid_grant\",\n        \"error_description\"\
    : \"The authorization code is invalid or expired.\"\n    }\n\n#### Parameters\n\
    \n| Name         | Description                                               \
    \                                                       |\n| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| grant_type   | **Required** Should be the value `authorization_code`  \
    \                                                          |\n| code         |\
    \ **Required** The authorization code that was received in the redirect from the\
    \ authorize endpoint                |\n| redirect_uri | **Required** The URL in\
    \ your application where users will be sent with an authorization code after authorization\
    \ |\n| state        | **Required** An unguessable random string, used to protect\
    \ against CSRF attacks                                  |\n\n### Refresh Tokens\n\
    \nIf an access token has expired you can use the refresh token that was sent in\
    \ the response from the token endpoint to get a new access token.\n\nNote that\
    \ if the user has revoked the consent to your app, the refresh token will no longer\
    \ be valid.\n\nTo get a new access token from the refresh token, use the token\
    \ endpoint with the grant type `refresh_token`:\n\n    POST https://fiken.no/oauth/token\n\
    \    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Authorization: Basic\
    \ dXNlIHlvdXIgY2xpZW50IGlkOmFuZCBjbGllbnQgc2VjcmV0\n\n    grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN\n\
    \nThe response contains a fresh access token along with a possibly updated refresh\
    \ token:\n\n    {\n      \"access_token\": \"K2QwoFp4ZfugWLWk7Ipu9kni5cyv3luXKQ-GDShvV2g=\"\
    ,\n      \"refresh_token\": \"naFOD_j8m6PFGcP0pfImVZlSxKklHLbgj9Hzao4rhg8=\",\n\
    \      \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\n      \"expires_in\": 86157\n    }\n\n####\
    \ Parameters\n\n| Name         | Description                                 \
    \                                                                     |\n| :-----------\
    \ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| grant_type   | **Required** Should be the value `refresh_token`       \
    \                                                          |\n| refresh_token|\
    \ **Required** The refresh token last returned for this user from the token endpoint\
    \                               |\n\n### Using Access Tokens in API Requests\n\
    \nTo execute API requests on behalf of the end user, send the access token obtained\
    \ at the token endpoint as a bearer token, as in this example:\n\n    GET https://api.fiken.no/api/v2/companies\n\
    \    Authorization: Bearer <access_token_value>\n\n### Revoking tokens\n\nTo revoke\
    \ an access token and refresh token use the Revoke Token endpoint.\n\nThe Revoke\
    \ Token endpoint disables the application grant, the access token and the corresponding\
    \ refresh token used to authenticate the call. Other access tokens obtained from\
    \ the same refresh token are also revoked.\n\n    POST https://fiken.no/oauth/revoke\n\
    \    Authorization: Bearer <access_token_value>\n\nThe response for a successful\
    \ revocation is 200/OK.\n\n### Managing access\n\nThe end user can manage which\
    \ companies a given app has access to under **Rediger konto -> Sikkerhet -> Apper\
    \ du har gitt tilgang til**. \nAll companies created after the initial consent\
    \ has been given need to be actively added so that the app will have access to\
    \ their information. \nAdditionally the end user can revoke access to any of their\
    \ companies' data as well.\n\n\n## Try It Out\n\nFor each endpoint in the documentation\
    \ below there is a button *Try It Out*. To invoke the API from this documentation\
    \ you need an app and you need to authorize usage for you Fiken.no user.\n\nYour\
    \ app needs to be configured with a redirect URL for this documentation, add `https://api.fiken.no/api/v2/docs/oauth2-redirect.html`\
    \ to the list of redirect URLs for your app.\n\nClick the padlock symbol on any\
    \ of the endpoints and enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` and then press\
    \ *Authorize* to start the OAuth2 authorization flow, then click *Close*.\n\n\
    Enter the required parameters for the endpoint, such as `company_slug`, and then\
    \ press *Execute* to test.\n\n## Request\n\nWe recommend sending the `X-Request-ID`\
    \ header with all requests.\n\n### Request Headers\n| Request  Header        \
    \   | Format   | Description                                                 \
    \      |\n| ----------------          | -------- | -----------------------------\
    \                                     |\n| `X-Request-ID`            | UUID  \
    \   | UUID used to identify the request                                 |\n\n\n\
    \n## Response\n### Response code\nAll HTTP codes should be expected with their\
    \ normal semantics. These are some of the common ones:\n\n* **200** for successful\
    \ GET\n* **201** for successful POST where you get a Location-header for the created\
    \ content\n* **400** when invalid content has be sent (for instance a required\
    \ field is missing, unexpected fields, wrong format, etc)\n* **401** when the\
    \ user is not authenticated\n* **403** when the user does not have the proper\
    \ authorization\n* **404** when the requested content is not found\n* **405**\
    \ When you are trying a method to a resource which doesn't support it (i.e. DELETE\
    \ on an account).\n* **415** Wrong media type. we accept application/json only.\n\
    \n### Response Content\nThe default content type on the result of GET requests\
    \ is application/json. On successful POSTs/PUTs/PATCHs and DELETEs an empty body\
    \ is returned.\n\nFor successful POSTs/PUTs/PATCHs a Location header is given\
    \ in all cases.\n\n## Pagination, Sorting & Filtering\nPagination, sorting and\
    \ filtering query parameters are all optional.\n\n\n| URI                    \
    \                                                 | Pagination? | Sortable? |\

    ### Pagination\nBy default the API sets `page=0` and `pageSize=25` and returns\
    \ the first 25 elements in a collection resource, if nothing else is specified.\n\
    PageSize has a maximum value of 100 meaning that you can only access at most 100\
    \ elements at once.\n\nTo request a collection resource with pagination, query\
    \ the resource with the query filters page and pageSize, note that both query\
    \ parameters need to be set to enable pagination.\nThe page counter starts at\
    \ 0. The response will contain up to Fiken-Api-Page-Size elements and the response\
    \ headers below, detailing how many elements the resource has in total and the\
    \ total number of pages as well.\n\nBy default the API returns the resources in\
    \ the order they were created, if nothing else is specified in the documentation.\n\
    \n#### Pagination Response Headers\n| Response Header           | Format   | Description\
    \                                                       |\n| ----------------\
    \          | -------- | -----------------------------                        \
    \             |\n| `Fiken-Api-Page`          | integer  | From the request header\
    \                                           |\n| `Fiken-Api-Page-Size`     | integer\
    \  | From the request header                                           |\n| `Fiken-Api-Page-Count`\
    \    | integer  | The total number of pages in this resource with this page size\
    \    |\n| `Fiken-Api-Result-Count`  | integer  | The total number of elements\
    \ in this resource                     |\n\n### Sorting\nTo change the sort order\
    \ for a resource, set the sortBy query parameter to a sort field in either ascending\
    \ or descending order. Ex: `https://api.fiken.no/api/v2/companies?sortBy=name%20asc`\n\
    \n### Filtering\nSome collections support filtering, and depending on the type\
    \ of field, different filters can be used. Dates are the most complex, and allow\
    \ you do apply different filters with different parameter names. For instance,\
    \ for a field called date, the following mutations are available:\n\n| Parameter\
    \ | Field | Format    | Description                                   |\n| ---\
    \       |---    | ---       |---                                            |\n\
    |  `date`   |date\t|yyyy-MM-dd\t|date equal to parameter value               \
    \   |\n|  `dateLe`\t|date\t|yyyy-MM-dd\t|date less than or equal to parameter\
    \ value     |\n|  `dateLt`\t|date\t|yyyy-MM-dd\t|date less than parameter value\
    \                 |\n|  `dateGe`\t|date\t|yyyy-MM-dd\t|date greater than or equal\
    \ to parameter value  |\n|  `dateGt`\t|date\t|yyyy-MM-dd\t|date greater than parameter\
    \ value              |\n\nAll date-fields will have these mutations of parameter\
    \ name that applies\n\n## Data Types\nThese are simple data-types that are used\
    \ in several of our objects.\n\n### Date\nDates are represented as strings formatted\
    \ as yyyy-MM-dd.\n\"Last modified\" returns the date of last modification of the\
    \ object. \nIf the object was never modified after creation, last modified date\
    \ is equal to created date. \n\n##### Examples:\nJanuary 2nd, 1970: \"1970-01-02\"\
    \n\n### Amount\nAmounts are always represented as a number, and specifies the\
    \ number of cents in the amount. Fractions will be ignored.\n\n##### Examples:\n\
    One thousand: 100000\n\nOne hundred and twelve cents: 10012\n\n### Account\nAn\
    \ account is a string with either four digits, or four digits, a colon and five\
    \ digits (\"reskontro\").\n\n##### Examples:\n3020\n\n1500:10001\n\n### VAT Code\n\
    Fiken's VAT codes are based upon Sticos mvakoder. To see all VAT codes go to Fiken\
    \ support, check the \"Mva kode\"-selector in the Fiken web interface while creating\
    \ a genereal ledger item (\"Fri postering\"). \nSee below the mapping between\
    \ VAT codes and types (codes are used at the transaction level while types are\
    \ used for sales and purchases).\n\n| Vat Code | Vat Type                    \
    \                                                                            \

        Creates an invoice. This corresponds to "Ny faktura" in Fiken.
        There are two types of invoice lines that can be added to an invoice line: product line or free text line.
        Provide a product Id if you are invoicing a product. All information regarding the price and VAT for this product will be added to the invoice.
        It is however also possible to override the unit amount by sending information in both fields "productId" and "unitAmount".
        An invoice line can also be a free text line meaning that no existing product will be associated with the invoiced line.
        In this case all information regarding the price and VAT of the product or service to be invoiced must be provided.
